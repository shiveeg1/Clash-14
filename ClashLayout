		***Work Description***
		1) All questions have been segregated into four files according to markings and plagiarism has been removed.
		2) One last re-review has to be done for which a group of questions will be re-reviewed
		   in teams of 2 removing ambiguity on 1 fixed day.
		3) Old questions are to be included for senior set.
		4) That done, 2 seperated DB (one for Juniors and another one for Seniors will be created). Access of questions from these will be 
			done randomly.
		5) A test for one by one retrieval ofquestions have to be checked for lag.
